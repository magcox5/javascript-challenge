    * js

      * data.js (contains database of ufo sightings)
      
### UFO-level-1
Filters the provided ufo.js database by a date entered by the user.

### UFO-level-2
Filters the provided ufo.js database by one or more of the following criteria:  date, city, state, country, shape.  
Initially, I tried creating a variable to hold all the filter conditions and execute one filter function.
This didn't work, so I executed a filter function for each criteria selected.
